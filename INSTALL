This file will walk you through setting up a WiPi-Analyzer-Server

Ubuntu Server install

NOTE: follow these steps if you need to setup a server from scratch

1) boot the ISO
2) choose your language
3) choose "Install Ubuntu Server"
4) choose language / keyboard [ for US choose defaults ] 
5) When you get to choose hostname set your hostname [ recommended: wipi-server ]
6) Set user name and user to [ wipi ]
7) set your password [ don't forget this ]
8) do not encrypt your home directory
9) set correct timezone
10) choose [ Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM ] WARNING: this will erase the current hard drive!!
11) choose yes to make changes, and choose the size it presents, and yes to make changes
	-- The install process should start now

13) You can choose to install LAMP server at this point if you like 
14) Choose OpenSSH server, then continue
15) Choose Yes to install GRUB
16) Then continue to reboot system
17) after boot up, login locally
18) type [ ifconfig | grep inet ]
19) one of the listed ip's is the ip address of your server
20) you can now ssh from another machine if need be to continue on with the wipi-server setup



Ubuntu Server Setup
======================
NOTE: Once you have a server online, follow these steps to set it up to be a WiPi-Server

WARNING: These steps assume this is a fresh installed, dedicated server, for the use of WiPi-Server Only!!!
		It is not recommended to follow this guide for an existing server!!!!
		-- If you already have a LAMP server going, and know what you are doing, then you
			can jump ahead to the section where you do the mysql provisioning

|If you are running this in a container or did not create a user during install besides root please do the following to add the user wipi and set your timezone
useradd wipi -m

|After entering the command below you will be prompted to enter a password for the user. Once done switch to the user and proceed with the installation steps
passwd wipi

|Set your timezone with the following command. You'll want to check for your specific timezone in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory. Central Time in USA example below.
cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime

|Switch to your wipi user
su - wipi

|New Install steps only!
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install tasksel
sudo tasksel install lamp-server
	-- set  your root mysql password; write it down
	-- after the install completes, try loading the following from your web browser
		http://the.ip.of.server
		-- if you get the "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page" your lamp install was succesful
|Install php-xml for Userspice install
sudo apt install php-xml

|Run these commands to ensure https is running on your site [ New Install steps only! ]
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2ensite *
sudo service apache2 reload
	-- now try loading the following https site from your web browser
		https://the.ip.of.server
		-- if you get the "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page" your https setup was succesful


|MYSQL setup
mysql -u root -p -e "create database wipi_analyzer;"
mysql -u root -p -e "grant all privileges on wipi_analyzer.* to 'wipi'@'localhost' identified by 'yourwipipassword'; flush privileges;"



!!!!! NOTE: If you plan to have WiPi-Analyzer-Server public facing then I highly recommend password protecting it.
	I have documention within ./userspice/INSTALL on how to setup wipi-analyzer-server with password protection
	using UserSpice



Setup WiPi-Analzyer-Server website without password protection [ Ignore these steps if using Userspice ]
==================================================================================================
NOTE:  WiPi gathers mac addresses and hostnames of all the devices on your network!
	By not password protecting WiPi-Server then all that information will be public
	if you have your WiPi-Server public facing on the internet.  If you plan to only
	use WiPi-Server and a WiPi client in a closed network, then you can continue.
		--Or continue if you just don't care :)

mkdir /var/www/html/wipi-analyzer-server

cd /var/www/html/wipi-analyzer-server

git init

git pull https://github.com/burton7d8/wipi-analyzer-server master

sudo chown -R wipi:www-data /var/www/html/wipi-analyzer-server/*

mysql -u root -p wipi_analyzer < wipi_analyzer.sql

|setup wipi config for your passwords
vim wipi_config.php
-- ensure $using_userspice = "no";
-- change all the passwords accordingly in this file
-- :x

WiPi-Server should now be available to use via https://the.ip.of.server/wipi-analyzer-server/
